# Homework Week 1

This project reperesents my attempt to refactor the code for the Horiseon Website into a more readable, userfriendly code where it easier to find elements on the main page.

## Steps

Firstly, I made sure to fix the broken link in the header that should have linked to the search-engine-optimization tag. As there was no tag ID I created one in the appropriate section.

I used semantic tags, Section and Article to break out the different sections of the page, rather than the Div tags. This should make it easier for anyone to get into the html file and find the correct part of the page if further editiors are required. I also added comments before each section so it is easier for someone to determine what section of the page they are looking at.

I consoloditated the classes with the same CSS formatting to so that there didn't have to be any duplicate  CSS code. This should allow anyone who tried to adjust the font in the content/ benefits sections to be able to update it for all articles without altering multiple CSS rules.

I also added some meta tags in order to make the site more SEO friendly.
